# Kaththu Gnerator

A simple vibe-coded app to generate kaththu (കത്ത്) which means "Letter" in malayalam. 
Thought it would be fun to send cover letters to employers in this fashion.
Has an editor mode that allows customizing the envelope and the letter contents.
A shareable link that can be sent to the recipient.

## Running the code
